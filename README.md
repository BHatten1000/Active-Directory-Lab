<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Spin up a VM using virtualbox to act as our Domain Controller: <br/>

 - Utilize an ISO for Server 2019 or whatever is used at your organization.
 - Be sure to setup two NICs. One running NAT and the other for the internal network.

Name and Configure Network Adapters:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eaQchnK.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
  
  - Name your NICs for ease of use.
  - Configure the one facing the "Internet" to use DHCP
  - Configure the internal NIC with its own static IP and subnet mask. This machine is our "default gateway" so in the DNS field enter the loopback address of 127.0.0.1 as seen below:

Install Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/y66oisa.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
   
   - Launch Server Manager and select 'Add roles and features'; Proceed through the menu, selecting the Domain Controller and selecting 'Active Directory Domain Services'
   <p align="center">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pZ4Mkm3.png" height="80%" width="80%"
      
   - Once the role has been installed select the caution icon in Server Manager and promote the server to a domain controller.
   - In the following menu select 'Add a new forest' and proceed to name your domain. Proceed by hitting 'Next' and finally 'Install' Your DC will reboot.

Create your Domain Admin Account:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SIZoCcK.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Create Domain Admin"/>
    
   - Launch AD Users and Computers and create an OU for Admins.
   - Within that OU create your Domain Admin account and make it a member of the "Domain Admins" default group.
   - Logout and then login wiith your Domain Admin credentials.
    
<br />

Configure Remote Access Server and Network Address Translation: <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9IT5RHh.png" width="80%" alt="Windows Setup Wizard"/>  

  - In Server Manager select 'Tools', 'Routing and Remote Access', and then right click on your DC and 'Configure and Enable'
  - Continue by hitting 'Next' and select 'Network Address Translation' this will enable our client or user machines to connect to the internet through the DC's IP.
  - When prompted select your internet facing network adapter and select 'Finish'

Setup DHCP on Domain Controller(to give client machines IP addresses):  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6R4b85W.png" height="80%" width="80%"/>
    
   - Return to Server Manager and select 'Add Roles and Features'. 
   - Select your DC, proceed with 'Next' and select 'DHCP' and 'Add Role'.
   - After a short wait your DHCP role will finish installing but still needs a scope. 
   - Return to the 'Tools' menu and select 'DHCP' 
   - In the DHCP configuration menu right click on 'IPv4' and select 'New Scope' then name and define your scope. These IP addresses represent the available addresses for any host machines that you add to your test enviornment in the future.
   - Define exlusions (if you have any) and lease duration

   - When prompted select 'Yes, I want to configure these options now' and proceed to specify the default gateway (in our case this is the DC's IP address), DNS servers, and Domain name as shown below:

Finally, Powershell to create 1000 users: <br/>
     
   - Modify the script located [here](https://github.com/BHatten1000/Active-Directory-Lab/blob/main/Generate-Names-Create-Users) to your use case. You may want to change the default password or increase or reduce the number of Users. (The script will create a new OU called _Users and generate a number of users within it. It will also create usernames in FLast format. Finally it will and apply the plain text password to ALL of them to build out a userbase for our AD lab.)
    
   - Remember to download the txt file of randomly generated names located [here](https://github.com/BHatten1000/Active-Directory-Lab/blob/main/names.txt) or utilize a file of your own in the same format called names.txt 
    
   - After configuring and running the script linked above (from the directory that names.txt is stored in) you should have a large userbase to experiment with:

Create a client machine: <br/>
     
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Sqw0YkQ.png" height="80%" width="80%"/>
    
  - Return to Virtual Box and spin up another machine to act as a client in our virtual AD enviornment. You will need an ISO of the OS that you are planning on using. I used windows 10 Pro.
  - Name the client whatever you prefer; I used 'Client1'. Make your OS selection and allocate resources.
  - Configure this VM's NIC to the 'Internal Network Adapter' setting to mimic a corporate domain.
  - Be sure not to install the home edition of windows, you cannot domain join that version of the OS. 
  - Once your client VM is created go ahead and domain join it and change its name to match the name you created in virtualbox.
